    <p> The earliest movies that talks about female equality while showing filial piety in an Asian setting.</p>
    
    <h3>Disney Pixar Up </h3>
    <p> The first Disney movie that showed love and lost in a marriage. It also tells us to live our dreams and not wait till its too late.</p>
    
    <h3>Marvel Immortals </h3>
    <p> Although it was powerpacked with stars such as the actress Angelina Jolie, ultimately it was about humankind, people and protecting those they love.</p>
